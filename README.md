# BCB430 Notes
## September 18th 2019

### De novo
#### Trinity VS ABYSS 
- is abyss-trans for denovo, slightly worse needs more preprocessing (Eric)
- Cleaning is a lot more simple than I thought because trinity does more processing than average to normalize
#### Error messages
- resolved: was writing to a repository that did not have write permissions from the compute node
- TODO: finish running Trinity 
#### Outlook 
- good: should have Trinity done by next week 

### AGENT
#### Upload
- Upload works, parse works
- Questions: how to display parsed data correctly as cytoscape object
- TODO: 
1. turn into cytoscape object properly 
2. display object 
#### Layouts 
- one complete, cerebral and polywas are 5 years old and of a different format
- TODO: ask how to integrate these
#### Code Refactoring 
- readSif is refactored
- MenuSideBar.js has a lot of repeat styling code
- TODO: Order React book and learn more about dummy components 
#### Outlook
- Okay: need to do more research into different topics above
